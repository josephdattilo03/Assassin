# Assassin (this site is still being constructed, so it may be buggy.)

### A minimalist flask website that allows users to create and run their own Assassin games.

### But what is Assassin?

Assassin (also Killer) is a live-action game in which players try to eliminate one another using mock weapons, in an effort to become the last surviving player.

Assassin is particularly popular on college campuses; several universities have a dedicated "Assassins' Guild" society, which organizes games for their members. Gameplay occurs at all hours and in all places unless otherwise disallowed by the rules. Since an elimination attempt could occur at any time, successful players are obliged to develop a degree of vigilance.

### How to play?

1.) Identify your players - Get a group together of four or more people that are willing to play.

2.) Choose a weapon - Find a common weapon(s) to eliminate your targets. It should be something recognisable so that other players clearly recognise when they are out of the game.

3.) Choose an immunity condition (Optional) - Oftentimes games will have a condition that makes the player invincible. Make sure that the condition is something that people are not willing to do all the time (for example, having an umbrella open inside).

4.) Establish areas of immunity (Optional) - Players can agree on areas in which they will be immune (for example, being in class)

5.) Play the game - When you kill a player, you recieve their target. Continue this cycle until only one person remains.

### What making this site taught me.
1.) Connecting frontend and backend - This is my first experience creating a dynamic website. I had improved my skills at html and css, but this is the first time I have tied it together with a backend and frontend library.

2.) The importance of having a plan and DRY - One of the biggest issues I had with this project was scalability. When I decided I wanted to add a new feature, I felt as though I could have organised better to make the integration process easier. Additionally, I only learned of some of the more in-depth features of jinja2 (frontend) later in the project, which caused a lot more difficuly creating new layouts.
